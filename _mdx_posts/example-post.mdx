## What is Python?

Python is a <span class="color-purple">broad-purpose</span> programming language that is designed to be <span class="color-purple">human-readable</span>. It was created by Guido van Rossum in the 1980s. Its simple syntax emphasizes readability. Unlike many other programming languages, Python code often reads like natural English sentences. According to [PYPL Programming Language Popularity Index](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html), Python is the world's most popular programming language.

### What makes Python so charming?

1.  It's easy to read and write.
2.  It's open-source and free.
3.  There are thousdands of _packages_ available.
4.  It's versatile. You can use Python for data science (machine learning, deep learning, AI), web development, desktop app development, low-level programs, game programming, and more.
5.  It has a massive community of users and supporters.

```python
netflix_debt = 28215119
netflix_equity = 11065240

# YOUR CODE BEGINS
debt_to_equity_ratio = netflix_debt / netflix_equity
# YOUR CODE ENDS
```

## Python Data Types

<Chip color="orange">What is it?</Chip>

A data type denotes the category of a value. In Python, ALL values have *data type*s. We'll go over a few **built-in** types. Built-in types are pre-defined data types that are part of the Python programming language itself.

- Text `"Hello World"` is a text type (`str` ).
- Number `475` is an integer type (`int` ).
- Number `1.99` is a float type (`float` ).
- Logical `True` is a boolean type (`bool`).

<Chip color="blue">Primitive vs Non-primitive</Chip>

Data types can be categorized into two types - _primitive_ and _non-primitive_ types. Technically speaking, Python only has _non-primitive_ types as everything is an object in Python. For the purpose of this course, you do not have to worry about differentiating between primitive and non-primitive types.
