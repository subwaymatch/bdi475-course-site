Python is a broad-purpose programming language that is designed to be human-readable. It was created by Guido van Rossum in the 1980s. Its simple syntax emphasizes readability. Unlike many other programming languages, Python code often reads like natural English sentences. According to [PYPL Programming Language Popularity Index](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html "PYPL PopularitY of Programming Language"), Python is the world's most popular programming language as of May 2022.

### What makes Python so charming?

1. üç∞ It's easy to read and write.
2. üî® It's [open-source](https://github.com/python/cpython) and free.
3. üöÄ There are thousdands of [packages](https://pypi.org/) available.
4. ü¶Ñ It's versatile. You can use Python for data science (machine learning, deep learning, AI), web development, desktop app development, low-level programs, game programming, and more.
5. ‚öîÔ∏è It has a massive community of users and supporters.

### Python and Data Analytics

<Chip color="orange">Why do we use Python?</Chip>

Python is a great programming language for data analytics.

First, Python has a wide offering of data analysis and visualization libraries. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is the de-facto standard library for data analysis which we will learn in later chapters. Libraries like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) are used for machine learning.

Second, Python offers a higher development speed, especially when it comes to working with data. Data analysts can quickly perform exploratory data analysis to obtain a high-level understanding of a dataset. They can also prototype a statistical model with well-maintained libraries.

Finally, Python is a great beginner's language. Recall that the Python syntax is human-readable. You can often _guess_ what a block of code is doing even if you don't fully understand Python.

Take this block of <Blue>Python</Blue> code as an example. Can you guess what it does?

```python
# Python code
lemonade_sales = [3, 9, 6, 3]
sales_target = 20

if sum(lemonade_sales) > sales_target:
  print("Exceeds sales target!")
else:
  print("Not quite there yet")
```

Compare that with another block of <Blue>Java</Blue> code. Would you believe me if this block of code does the exact same thing as the previous one?

```java
// Java code
public class SalesTargetChecker {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int[] lemonade_sales = new int[] { 3, 9, 6, 3 };
        int sales_target = 20;
        int total_sales = 0;

        for (int sale: lemonade_sales) {
            total_sales += sale;
        }

        if (total_sales > sales_target) {
            System.out.println("Exceeds sales target!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Not quite there yet");
        }
    }
}
```

## Running Python

<Chip color="black">Python Version</Chip>

There are three major Python versions - 1, 2, and 3. Most tutorials you find nowadays are based on version 3. The previous versions are deprecated and no longer supported. We recommend you to use version 3 unless you have a very specific reason to use one of the older versions (e.g., using a package that only supports version 2). All materials on this site use version 3.

You can programmatically check the Python version using the code below.

```python
import sys
print(sys.version)
```

```
# Output
3.9.5 (default, Feb 22 2022, 14:12:02)
[Clang 13.0.0]
```

<Chip color="black">Python Intrepreter</Chip>

To run Python locally, you will need to install a [Python interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If your goal is to simply learn Python through this website, you do not install a Python interpreter locally.

## Python Comments

When writing code, you may want to add notes for yourself or other humans. You can use *comment*s to write text that are ignored by the Python interpreter. There are two types of comments:

1. single-line
2. multi-line

<Chip color="green">Single-line Comment</Chip>

<div
  style={{
    color: "black",
    fontSize: "10rem",
    lineHeight: 1,
    fontWeight: 900,
    textAlign: "center",
    background: "-webkit-linear-gradient(#fff, #000)",
    WebkitBackgroundClip: "text",
    WebkitTextFillColor: "transparent",
  }}
>
  &#x23;
</div>

Lines that start with &#x23; are ignored by the Python interpreter.

```python
lemonade_price = 3

# Sales tax in Champaign is 9%
sales_tax = 0.09
```

You can also use the hash character (&#x23;) after a line of code to add an _inline comment_.

```python
lemonade_price = 3
sales_tax = 0.09    # Sales tax in Champaign is 9%
```

<Chip color="green">Multi-line Comment</Chip>

<div
  style={{
    color: "black",
    fontFamily: 'Consolas, "Courier New", monospace',
    fontSize: "10rem",
    lineHeight: 1,
    fontWeight: "bold",
    textAlign: "center",
    background: "-webkit-linear-gradient(#fff, #000)",
    WebkitBackgroundClip: "text",
    WebkitTextFillColor: "transparent",
  }}
>
  """
</div>

Any lines of code between a set of three single quotes (''') or three double quotes (""") are considered multi-line comments. The Python interpreter ignores those lines of code.

```python
"""
We sell lemonade at $3 per cup.
Sales tax in Champaign is 9%. This consists of:
  state: 6.25%
  county: 1.25%
  city: 1.5%
"""
lemonade_price = 3
sales_tax = 0.09
```

Recall that you can use a set of three single quotes (''') as well.

```python
'''
This is an example
of a multi-line comment
'''
```
