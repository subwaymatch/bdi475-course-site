### While Loops

<Chip color="purple">Indefinite Iteration</Chip>

Last time, we covered the first type of loop in Python - the `for` loop. A `for` loop takes a `list`-like data and iterates over each element.

Generally speaking, you use a `for` loop when you know how many times you'd like to iterate before entering the loop. `for i in range(6)` will iterate 6 times unless you explicitly exit the loop (which we haven't discussed yet).

The `while` loop serves a different purpose. You can use the `while` loop if you want to keep on iterating until a certain condition is satisfied.

At each iteration, the while loop checks whether a condition is satisfied. It will run **indefinitely** until the condition is NOT satisfied.

<Chip color="pink">Skip Discussion For Now</Chip>

Although `while` loops can be useful at times, we won't find many uses for the purpose of this course. For now, you only need to remember that `while` loops _can be_ used to keep iterating when you don't know how many times to loop in advance.

Now comes the data type that is **critical** in programming - the <span className="color-purple">dictionary</span> type.

### Dictionary

<Chip color="green">Key-Value Pairs</Chip>

Do you know what _terpsichorean_ means? How about _appoggiatura_? If you know... you must read dictionaries for fun. ðŸ¤¡ If you don't, you're on the same boat as me. Let's look these up in an English dictionary ( [https://www.dictionary.com/](https://dictionary.com) ).

<span className="color-green">Terpsichorean</span> is defined in the dictionary as
_"pertaining to dancing"_. <span className="color-purple">Appoggiatura</span> is
defined as _"a note of embellishment preceding another note and taking a portion
of its time"_ .

Why am I talking about these obscure vocabularies in a Data Analytics course? You're about to find out.

<Chip color="yellow">Creating an empty dictionary</Chip>

You can create an empty dictionary using the following syntax: `my_dict = {}`.

<Chip color="blue">Dictionary with initial values</Chip>

You can create a dictionary with initial values using the following syntax: `my_dict = { "my_key1": "my_value1", "my_key2": "my_value2" }` .

### Tuples

<Chip color="green">Immutable</Chip>

The final collection data type we'll discuss is the `tuple` type. A `tuple` is an immutable collection. You can only set the values when you create a `tuple`.

**TL;DR** It's EXACTLY like a list, but you can't update an element once you create it.
