## Operators

<Chip color="blue">What are they?</Chip>

Operators are symbols that perform various types of opertions. The most simple example is an addition (e.g., `1 + 1`), which performs an arithmetic operation.

Python operations are categorized into the following groups:

- Arithmetic Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Membership Operators
- Identity Operators

## Booleans

<Chip color="purple">Overview</Chip>

A **boolean** is a data type that can only represent two possible values - `True` or `False`. The name boolean originates from the English mathematician George Boole.

Although having only two possible values makes booleans look trivial, booleans will end up playing a critical role in writing your code.

A boolean `True` is NOT the same as a string `"True"` (note the double quotes around the text in string `"True"`).

    Even the most complex boolean _expressions_ in programming eventually boils down to a single boolean value.

    It controls the _flow_ of your program. We will soon see how `if` statements can conditionally run some code.

### Expressions

<Chip color="purple">Evaluated Chunk of Code</Chip>

If you're new to programming, an <Blue>expression</Blue> may mean the look on your face, or a group of words used to signal how you feel.

In the context of **mathematics**, an expression is <Pink>a combination of symbols that is well-formed according to the rules</Pink> that depend on the context (thank you Wikipedia).

<Chip color="green">For Us</Chip>

In the context of **programming**, an expression is <Green>a unit of code that can be evaluated to determine its value</Green> . This definition does not deviate far away from that of mathematics. We'll come back to how math and programming are intertwined.

A <Green>boolean expression</Green> is any expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`.

      either <code>True</code>
      or <code>False</code> depending on the value of the <code>hometown</code> variable.

### If...Else

<Chip color="green">Conditional Blocks</Chip>

Being able to use expressions to dynamically determine a value sounds... fancy. But how exactly is it _useful_?

This is where the <Green>conditional statements</Green> shine. Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions based on rules.

### Why are some lines indented?

<Chip color="green">Code Blocks</Chip>

Python uses indentation to define a block of code. What do you mean block of code? A block of code refers to <Purple>one or more lines of code that belong to if/elif/else statements, a function, or a loop.</Purple>

You can use however many spaces you want. However, you must be **consistent** in the number of spaces you use. Python will throw an error if you mix the number of spaces used for indentation.

<RowBoxItems title="Conditional Statements" color="blue">
<>
<Chip color="green">if</Chip>

`if` statements always come first. You must specify a condition here (`if cash > 100`). An `if` block is required before you use `elif` or `else`. You can only have one `if` statment in a set of `if/elif/else` statements.

</>
<>
<Chip color="yellow">elif</Chip>

`elif` statements come after the first `if` block. Similar to `if` statements, you must specify a condition for `elif` statements. You can have as many `elif` blocks as you'd like.

</>
<>
<Chip color="pink">else</Chip>

`else` statements come last. `else` statements caputure **any** cases that are not satisfied by the preceding `if/elif` statements.
