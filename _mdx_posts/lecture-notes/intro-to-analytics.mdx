## Introduction

<Chip color="black">Growth of data</Chip>

Organizations are accumulating data at an exponentially growing speed. Just a decade ago, the volume of data transferred in a year globally was estimated to be 5 zettabytes (that is approximately equivalent to 5,000,000,000,000,000 megabytes). In 2021, the volume of data transferred globally is estimated to be 79 zettabytes ([Source: Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/)).

But how are any of the 79,000,000,000,000,000 megabytes of data relevant to you? If you're looking to open a new retail branch as a business owner, data can provide insights on whether the new location has a high chance of success. If you're running a digital advertising campaign, you can swiftly adjust the campaign based on real-time feedback. As an auditor, you can perform control tests using structured transaction data. For every scenario we just discussed, the end goal remains the same. You want to make **better decisions** using data.

<Chip color="black">What is Data Analytics?</Chip>

Data analytics is the science of deriving insights from raw data. It combines multiple disciplines from statistics, mathematics, programming, and even art! ðŸŽ¨ Data analytics is further categorized into four different types of analytics.

1.  **Descriptive Analytics**: Analyze historical and current data to describe what happened (or is happening)
2.  **Diagnostic Analytics**: Use data to understand _why_ something happened in the past
3.  **Predictive Analytics**: Predicts what is likely to happen in the future ðŸ”®
4.  **Prescriptive Analytics**: Test potential outcomes of each decision using advanced algorithms and recommends the best course of action

    <p>Finding or gathering data is the starting point of any analytical processes. Both numerical and categorical data can be collected.</p>

    <p>This step involves a repetitive process of loading, transforming, and digging through the data. Your goal is to find latent patterns that can be used to derive  insights.</p>

    <p>This step is often referred as a storytelling phase. You communicate your findings and suggest actions like you're telling a story. The most common approach is to graphically represent data.</p>
