## Preview (Development) and Production Branches

- `development` branch is used for all development activities. `development` branch can be viewed at [https://bdi475-course-site.vercel.app/](https://bdi475-course-site.vercel.app/).
- `main` branch points to the the production site ([https://bdi475.org](https://bdi475.org)). Any pushes to the `main` branch will trigger a deployment through Vercel.
- `production` branch is not used anymore.

## Changelogs

### Fall 2021

- Updated [Pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide) to version `0.18` to support Safari and mobile browsers.

- Updated [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) to version `11.1` for `webpack` v5 support, faster builds, and web fonts optimizations.

- Updated [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to v5. No noticeable change other than a few breaking classnames.

- Switched all [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) services (auth, firestore, functions) to [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) because:
  - Students in China could not use the site without using a VPN since Google services are blocked in China.
  - Firebase is proprietary. Supabase is open-source.
  - Pagination with Firestore is unnecessarily complicated.
  - Supabase uses Postgres as a backing database. This makes it easy to make joined queries.
  - Supabase provides a [type generator](https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/generating-types) that works seamlessly with Typescript.

## Roadmap ðŸ¦œ

These are features I'm looking to add.

- Multiple choice questions
- SQLite coding challenge support using [sql.js](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js/)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) support
- Live polling feature

## Local development

Clone the repository and run the development server using one of the commands below:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
