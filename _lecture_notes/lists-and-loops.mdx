title: Lists and Loops
objectives:
  - Review `if`, `elif`, `else` statements.
  - Introduce the `list` data type.
  - Learn how to create, access, edit a list.
  - Use a `for` loop to iterate over a list.
  - Use a `while` loop to iterate until a condition is satisfied.

## Introduction to Lists

<Chip color="green">Overview</Chip>

The code you wrote above is great. But with a degree from the U of I, you will likely get more than one job offer. Assume you get three offers. Can you reuse the logic you've already written? Yes! But we'll first need to cover a new data type (`list`) and a new syntax (`for` loops).

Last time, we talked about `bool`, `int`, `float`, and `str` types. Variables with these three types can only contain a single value. That's why they are called basic types. The `list` type is the first non-basic data type we've seen. Square brackets (`[]`) are used to denote a list type.

## Python Data Types

<Chip color="orange">What is it?</Chip>

A data type denotes the category of a value. In Python, ALL values have *data type*s. We'll go over a few **built-in** types. Built-in types are pre-defined data types that are part of the Python programming language itself.

- Text `"Hello World"` is a text type (`str` ).
- Number `475` is an integer type (`int` ).
- Number `1.99` is a float type (`float` ).
- Logical `True` is a boolean type (`bool`).

<Chip color="blue">Primitive vs Non-primitive</Chip>

Data types can be categorized into two types - _primitive_ and _non-primitive_ types. Technically speaking, Python only has _non-primitive_ types as everything is an object in Python. For the purpose of this course, you do not have to worry about differentiating between primitive and non-primitive types.
