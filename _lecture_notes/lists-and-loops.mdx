## Introduction to Lists

<Chip color="green">Overview</Chip>

The code you wrote above is great. But with a degree from the U of I, you will likely get more than one job offer. Assume you get three offers. Can you reuse the logic you've already written? Yes! But we'll first need to cover a new data type (`list`) and a new syntax (`for` loops).

Last time, we talked about `bool`, `int`, `float`, and `str` types. Variables with these three types can only contain a single value. That's why they are called basic types. The `list` type is the first non-basic data type we've seen. Square brackets (`[]`) are used to denote a list type.

### Accessing list elements by index

<Chip color="blue">Zero-based Index</Chip>

What does that `offers[0]` do? The square brackets used in `offers[0]` denote the _index_ of the element you're trying to retrieve. `offers[0]` retrieves the first value in the array, which is `55000` in our code. But why does the index start at zero, not one?

In many programming languages including Python, you start counting indices at zero, not one. To retrieve the second item from `my_list`, the correct code would be `my_list[1]`, not `my_list[2]`.

### Negative list indices

<Chip color="blue">From the end of the list</Chip>

You can also access elements from the end of the array using a negative index. Negative indices begin at `-1`. `my_list[-1]` will select the **last element** in `my_list`.

Similarly, `my_list[-2]` will select the second to the last element in `my_list`.

### How many elements are in a list?

<Chip color="black">Length of a list</Chip>

You can retrieve the number of items in a list by using `len(my_list)` syntax.

### Working with lists

<Chip color="purple">List methods</Chip>

Python provides multiple list methods (if you're not familiar with what a "method" is, think of it as some operation on a list - like adding or removing an item).

A common operation is to add an item to an existing list. You can append an item to a list using `my_list.append(new_value)` syntax.

If you'd like to take a look at all available methods, refer to [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) .

### Can a list have elements with non-uniform data types?

<Chip color="pink">Mixed Types</Chip>

From the previous coding question, we're able to see that a list can have elements with mixed data types. A list can hold **any** data type. In fact, a list can hold another list, which is called a _nested list_. For now, let's keep it simple and not worry about nested lists.

    A list can contain a list that contains another list that contains another
    list... and so on.

### Do we really want to keep copy-pasting stuff?

<Chip color="red">Repetition is never good</Chip>

Well that's a little inefficient, isn't it? You may be okay with copy-pasting the `print(roster[n])` code a couple of times. But imagine if the `roster` list had 1,000 names. You'd be spending your entire afternoon copy-pasting and changing numbers.

### Another way to retrieve elements

<Chip color="black">A second syntax</Chip>

You can also use `for x in my_list` to iterate over each value in `my_list`. Note that `x` is an arbitrary name you pick. You can use any name. Any of the code below will work.

- `for x in my_list`
- `for a in my_list`
- `for my_value in my_list`
- `for any_variable_name in my_list`
