What is the output of the following code?

## Sample Code

```python
@requires_authorization(roles=["ADMIN"])
def somefunc(param1='', param2=0):
    r'''A adtertertertereteretdocstring'''
    if param1 > param2: # interesting
        print 'Gre\'ater'
    return (param2 - param1 + 1 + 0b10l) or None

class SomeClass:
    pass
```

## Another sample

Try writing a SQL script as well.

```sql
SELECT * FROM cities;
```

### Math equations

Euler\'s identity $e^{i\\pi}+1=0$ is a beautiful formula in $\\RR^2$.

Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following
equation.

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$

# This is the number $x = 13$ and this

$\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$

$$
E = mc^2
$$
