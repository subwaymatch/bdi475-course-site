This is an example post, with a [link](https://nextjs.org) and a React component:

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `gray-matter`. Additionally, links are rendered using a custom component passed to `next-mdx-remote`.

Go back [home](/).

What is the output of the following code?

## Sample Code

```python
@requires_authorization(roles=["ADMIN"])
def somefunc(param1='', param2=0):
    r'''A adtertertertereteretdocstring'''
    if param1 > param2: # interesting
        print 'Gre\'ater'
    return (param2 - param1 + 1 + 0b10l) or None

class SomeClass:
    pass
```

## Another sample

Try writing a SQL script as well.

```sql
SELECT * FROM cities;
```

## Invalid lang

```java
test
```
