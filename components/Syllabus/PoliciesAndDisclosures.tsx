                    Emergencies can happen anywhere and at any time, so it's
                    important that we take a minute to prepare for a situation
                    in which our safety could depend on our ability to react
                    quickly. Take a moment to learn the different ways to leave
                    this building. If there's ever a fire alarm or something
                    like that, you'll know how to get out and you'll be able to
                    help others get out. Next, figure out the best place to go
                    in case of severe weather ‚Äì we'll need to go to a low-level
                    in the middle of the building, away from windows. And
                    finally, if there's ever someone trying to hurt us, our best
                    option is to run out of the building. If we cannot do that
                    safely, we'll want to hide somewhere we can't be seen, and
                    we'll have to lock or barricade the door if possible and be
                    as quiet as we can. We will not leave that safe area until
                    we get an Illini-Alert confirming that it's safe to do so.
                    If we can't run or hide, we'll fight back with whatever we
                    can get our hands on. If you want to better prepare yourself
                    for any of these situations, visit police.illinois.edu/safe.

                    The University of Illinois is committed to combating sexual
                    misconduct. Faculty and staff members are required to report
                    any instances of sexual misconduct to the University's Title
                    IX and Disability Office. In turn, an individual with the
                    Title IX and Disability Office will provide information
                    about rights and options, including accommodations, support
                    services, the campus disciplinary process, and law
                    enforcement options. A list of the designated University

                    responsibility and can maintain confidentiality, can be
